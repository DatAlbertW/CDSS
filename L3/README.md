# Clinical Decision Support System for Initial Management of Genital Ulcers

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to deploy a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for the initial management of genital ulcers.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Excel File**:
   - Download the file [Initial Management of Genital Ulcers.xlsx](https://github.com/DatAlbertW/CDSS/blob/main/L3/Initial%20Management%20of%20Genital%20Ulcers.xlsx).

2. **Upload the File to ODK**:
   - Go to the [ODK XLSForm Online Tool](https://getodk.org/xlsform/).
   - Upload the downloaded `Initial Management of Genital Ulcers.xlsx` file.
   - The tool will convert the Excel file into a format suitable for use in the ODK ecosystem.

3. **Deploy the Form**:
   - Follow the instructions on the ODK website to deploy the form to your ODK server.
   - Once deployed, the form will be available for use on ODK-compatible data collection apps.

## Task Description

The task involved creating a machine-readable code for a clinical decision support system using any standard that drives the L4 behavior. Hard-coded applications were accepted with consideration for user experience (e.g., sequence and grouping of questions) and maintainability of the code and data quality (e.g., constraint rules).

## Additional Information

For more details on how to use ODK and deploy forms, refer to the [ODK Documentation](https://docs.getodk.org/).
