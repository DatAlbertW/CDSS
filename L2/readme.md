## L2 Overview

This folder contains the following artifacts:

- High Level BPMN with a general overview of the process.
- Decision Logic, with a specific view of decisions flow.
- Data dictionary.
- The challenges that were faced when translating from the guidelines to the L2. [pdf](L2/Challenges in translation (L1-L2).pdf)

For a better visualization of the BPMN, we suggest the use of Camunda (https://camunda.com/de/bpmn/)
