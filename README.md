# CDSS
Clinical Decision Support Systems

# Introduction
- **Project focus:** Perform screening for sexually transmitted infections (L2), emphazising on the approach to patients with genital ulcers (L3).

- **Project goals:** Assist healthcare providers with evidence-based guidelines to guide their decisions and improve patient outcomes.

# Argument
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are a significant public health concern. In some cases, STIs are asymptomatic and can lead to complications like infertility, chronic pelvic pain, upper urinary tract infections, cervical cancer, and chronic infection (HIV). Screening is vital to identify, test, and treat patients and partners before any complication emerges and prevent transmission and reinfection.

# Group 7 (Members):
1. Alberto Wicker Vera
2. Gerardo Romeny Kunstmann
3. Erzhena Batorova
4. Janick Marti

# Tasks Overview

| **TASK** | **DELIVERED BY** | **STATUS** |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| **L1** | | |
| 1. Justification for Guidelines / Evidence (describe rationale for selection) | Alberto | ✅ |
| 2. Statement About the Healthcare Need (describe rationale for the problem to address) | Alberto | ✅ |
| 3. User Personas and Scenarios (Describe different users that will interact with the CDSS and provide 2 user scenarios on how the user will interact) | Erzhena | ✅ |
| **L2** | | |
| 1. BPMN (high level workflow) | Janick |✅|
| 2. Documentation | Gerardo |✅|
| 3. Data Element Table (data dictionary: Include 30-50 data elements with labels, types, response options, conditional logic, and derived data elements, mapped to standards where possible.) | Alberto, Janick| ✅|
| 4. Decision Logic (Specify decision logic using diagrams (BPMN) or decision tables (e.g., WHO SMART Guideline DAK) for diagnoses, treatment, or other relevant recommendations.) | Gerardo, Erzhena| |
| 5. Identify challenges in translation of the L1 to the L2 (where did decisions have to be taken or gaps filled?) | Alberto, Janick | ✅|
| **L3** | | |
| 1. Machine readable Code: any standard can be used as long it drives the L4 behaviour. Hard coded application will be accepted. (Consider UX (e.g. sequence and grouping of your questions) and maintainability of the code and data quality (e.g. constrain rules).) | Alberto, Jannick | ✅ |
| **L4** | | |
| 1. Executable CDSS: Think about user interface considerations – what will make the system more or less acceptable and usable to end-users. | Alberto |✅|
| **QUALITY ASSURANCE TESTING:** | | |
| 1. Design a risk-based testing approach, conduct tests to identify L2-L4 translation issues, and address any bugs or issues found. | Erzhena| |
| **IDENTIFICATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION STRATEGY:** | | |
| 1. Outline a plan for CDSS Implementation (how will it be provided to users and maintained? consider existing systems and user training) | Gerardo |✅|
| 2. Describe the approach for monitoring and evaluation (what are the objectives at different stages of maturity?, what are the positive and negative impacts?, what methods will be used? what challenges does the group anticipate?) | Gerardo |✅|
