## L3-L4 Overview

This repository contains the machine readable code created in[]() and instructions to deploy our Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for the initial management of genital ulcers.

## Instructions:
* The machine readable code can be downloaded by clicking this link [/Initial Management of Genital Ulcers.xlsx
](https://github.com/DatAlbertW/CDSS/blob/main/L3%20%3A%20L4/Initial%20Management%20of%20Genital%20Ulcers.xlsx).
* The xlsx file was Deployed using KoboToolbox.
* The file can be accessed directly in KoboToolbox or by loading the xlsx file in XLSForm Online.

**KoboToolbox:**
   - Please click on the following link to access the the form in KoboToolbox: [Initial Management of Genital Ulcers](https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/ggdroia8)

**ODK Deployment:**
1. **Download the Excel File**:
   - Download the file [Initial Management of Genital Ulcers.xlsx](https://github.com/DatAlbertW/CDSS/blob/main/L3/Initial%20Management%20of%20Genital%20Ulcers.xlsx).

2. **Upload the File to ODK**:
   - Go to the [ODK XLSForm Online Tool](https://getodk.org/xlsform/).
   - Upload the downloaded `Initial Management of Genital Ulcers.xlsx` file.
   - The tool will convert the Excel file into a format suitable for use in the ODK ecosystem.

3. **Deploy the Form**:
   - Follow the instructions on the ODK website to deploy the form to your ODK server.
   - Once deployed, the form will be available for use on ODK-compatible data collection apps.

## Task Description

The task involved creating a machine-readable code for a clinical decision support system using any standard that drives the L4 behavior. Hard-coded applications were accepted with consideration for user experience (e.g., sequence and grouping of questions) and maintainability of the code and data quality (e.g., constraint rules).

## Additional Information

For more details on how to use ODK and deploy forms, refer to the [ODK Documentation](https://docs.getodk.org/).
